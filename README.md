### A Data-Driven Study of Health Insurance Claim Behavior in Rural and Urban India

This project investigates the patterns and disparities in private health insurance utilization among rural and urban populations in Maharashtra, India. The study uses machine learning and statistical analysis to identify key factors affecting claim behaviors, satisfaction, and switching preferences.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze claim settlement trends and healthcare utilization patterns
- Compare behavior between urban and rural policyholders
- Predict claim likelihood using K-Nearest Neighbors
- Study satisfaction factors with Random Forests
- Segment policyholders via Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
- Model switching behavior with Multinomial Logistic Regression
